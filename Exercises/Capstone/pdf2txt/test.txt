One of the intriguing properties of clay minerals is swelling, which is considered an essential
characteristic for various geological processes, environmental science, and engineering. Almost all
previous experimental and simulation studies focused on the understanding of the swelling behavior
of pure clays. The fact is that about 30 percent of all clays are a pure type, and virtually 70 percent of clays
are the mixed-layer one that swelling mechanism is still elusive. In this research, molecular dynamics
simulations were used to exclusively investigate the effect of layer charge distribution on the crystalline
swelling and hydration behavior of
so-called
illite-montmorillonite mixed-layer clay (I-Mt MLC) with Na+ and K+ counterions in the presence of differ-
ent water concentrations. Based on the results, we found that the layer charge density and charge loca-
tion of both illite and Mt signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the I-Mt clays’ swelling behavior. Regardless of Mt
charge density, the presence of highly charged illite led to powerful interactions of counterions with
the surface sheet, resulting in less swelling behavior of the I-Mt system. Also, the various polarization
power of clay surface due to the difference in charge distribution of octahedral sheets had a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on water molecules and interlayer cations interaction with clay surface, which affected the
swelling behavior of I-Mt clays. Overall, our ﬁndings demonstrated the new insight into I-Mt clays’ swel-
ling behavior, which is a function of charge distribution of both illite and Mt.

1. Introduction

Clay minerals, as ﬁne-grained and porous materials, are formed
in the weathering and pedogenic processes and constitute a large
portion of soils and sediments [1]. Clays are characterized by a
large surface area, strong adsorption capacity, and high swelling
capacity, which make them valuable compounds in a broad spec-
trum of applications of environmental remediation [2,3] geological
processes [4-6], nuclear waste disposal [7-10] chemical catalysis
[11-13], drug delivery [14-16], and in drilling ﬂuids to modify
the rheology and control the borehole stability of oil and gas wells
[17-20]. In particular, the swelling behavior of clays is of signiﬁcant
importance in the oil and gas industry, as clays in various types are
found in geological formation as well as drilling ﬂuids. In fact, dur-
ing the drilling operation, water interactions as a base of major
drilling ﬂuids with clayey formations can cause swelling, which
results in wellbore instability. Therefore, understanding the swel-
ling behavior of clayey formation is a critical
factor in the

successful design of drilling ﬂuid and utilizing the proper clay
swelling inhibitors [19,21].

According to the previous studies, the swelling behavior of clays
exhibits two stepwise regimes, including crystalline and osmotic
swelling [22,23]. Crystalline swelling of clay minerals occurs in a
stepwise formation of one to three hydration states from the dehy-
drated state through a gradual increase of water adsorption in the
clay interlayer. The interlayer space ranges from 9 to around 19 Å
for crystalline swelling [24-26]. Virtually all types of clay minerals
display crystalline swelling in the presence of a water solution.
Osmotic swelling occurs due to an increase in interlayer water
intake from an aqueous solution that culminates in interlayer
expansion from 20 to 130 Å [25,27,28]. Contrary to crystalline
swelling, osmotic swelling of clay minerals is only limited to some
speciﬁc clays [29,30].

There are comprehensive studies of interlayer swelling on pure
clay systems. Based on previous researches, various inﬂuencing
factors have been introduced to understand the swelling behaviors
of clay minerals. Factors related to the clay such as charge site loca-
tion and charge density [26,27,29-31], ion size [22,32,33], ion
charge [32-34], and identity of interlayer ions [24,29,35,36] can
affect clay swelling. As stated previously, the swelling properties

of clay minerals are not the same in which Na+-montmorillonite
(Na+-Mt) tends to swell easily from monolayer hydration state
up to osmotic swelling, while K+-illite (K+-I) has less tendency to
swell [36]. Regarding the impact of charge location and charge
density on clay swelling, previously reported results are restricted,
and drawing the exact conclusions is nearly impossible. For exam-
ple, Liu and Lu [36] showed that in large charge density on tetrahe-
dral sheets, clay interlayer experiences more expansion compared
to clay with a high charge density of octahedral sheets. These com-
parisons were conducted for three different water contents. In
comparing the swelling behavior of Otay- montmorillonite (Otay-
Mt), in which concentration of charge is on octahedral sheets with
Wyoming-Mt that has less charge density on octahedral sheets,
Chávez-Páez et al. [38] revealed that interlayer expansion of the
Otay-Mt is lower than Wyoming-Mt. Smith et al. [39] assessed
the effect of octahedral charge density on swelling of Na-Mt, and
they found that more charge density on octahedral sheets results
in higher interlayer expansion. However, Foster [40] reported a
reduction in swelling of Mt as the charge density of octahedral
sheets increases. Seppälä et al. [41] claimed that the smaller the
layer charge, the greater swelling would result. Sun [42] and Great-
house et al. [43] found similar results. Skipper et al. [44] reported
that increasing the tetrahedral charge layer of Na+-Mt leads to
increasing interlayer expansion. Interaction of water with Mt and
beidellite was studied by Teich-McGoldrick et al. [29]. They
showed that in the case of low water content between interlayers,
beidellite, which has a similar structure to illite, expands more
than Mt. However, Mt showed more interlayer expansion at a high
water content. Also, they observed that the beidellite formed the
bilayer hydration state at low water content compared to Mt. More
recently, Li et al. [37] found that clay minerals with different
charge locations and charge densities display divergent swelling
behaviors. They showed that K+ has dual characteristics in which
their behavior as swelling inhibitors relies on the charge location
of clay. However, Ferrage et al. [45] reported that due to the low
hydration of K+ and their perturbable characteristics, they could
act as a clay swelling inhibitor.

Most of the studies related to clay swelling have been focused
on pure clays. In 2018, for the ﬁrst time, the swelling behavior of
mixed-layer clays (MLCs), including I-Mt clays for a wide range
of water concentrations in the presence of Na+ and K+, were inves-
tigated [46]. They showed that the swelling behavior of I-Mt is sig-
niﬁcantly different from pure clay and depends on both clay types
and interlayer cations. More recently, a comprehensive study was
conducted on the swelling behavior of a chlorite-montmorillonite
mixed-layer clay (CH-Mt MLC) as a function of interlayer cation
including Na+, K+, and Cs+ [47].

The fact is that in addition to the pure clays, plenty of MLCs can
be found in various types of sedimentary rocks [48,49]. Among dif-
ferent kinds of MLCs, illite-montmorillonite (I-Mt) is the most
abundant compared to others such as CH-Mt or even illite-
chlorite-montmorillonite (I-CH-Mt). As previously mentioned, var-
ious factors affect the swelling behavior of pure clays. However,
these factors may have different inﬂuences on the swelling behav-
ior of MLCs. In the present study, we focused on I-Mt MLCs. As is
known, both the illite and Mt consist of negatively charged octahe-
dral sheets of alumina (O) and tetrahedral sheets of silica (T). They
are categorized as TOT type clay which means that the octahedral
sheet is located between two tetrahedral sheets. The negative
charge of layers comes from the isomorphic substitution of layers
in which Si+4 is replaced with Al+3 in tetrahedral sheets, and Al3+
in octahedral sheets is substituted with Mg2+. The major difference
between the two mentioned clays is related to the location of iso-
morphic substitution. Most of the charge distribution of illite and
Mt are on the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets, respectively. The
interlayer counterions of Mt can be Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, and the

illite is balanced by K+. As previously
negative charge of
mentioned, the nature of these cations also greatly inﬂuences the
swelling of clays. Therefore, the presence of two types of counteri-
ons, in this study Na+ and K+, with various concentrations between
the two different clay sheets makes swelling process analysis more
complex.

Almost all previous investigations of the effects of charge distri-
bution on clay swelling behavior have been limited to pure clay to
date except works by Rahromostaqim and Sahimi [46,47]. How-
ever, no comprehensive research has been conducted on the I-Mt
MLCs with various charge densities and charge locations to know
their effects on swelling behavior. In this work, the impacts of
the surface charge distribution by considering charge density and
charge location on the swelling behavior of K+-illite-Na+-
montmorillonite (K+-I-Na+-Mt) were investigated for a wide range
of water concentrations. Four mixed layers I-Mt clay mineral struc-
tures with different charge densities (i.e., high charge (HC) and low
charge (LC)) were considered. The molecular dynamics (MD) simu-
lation technique has been applied to provide insight into the
effects of the mentioned factors. To better understand the swelling
mechanism, the results obtained from swelling behavior analyses
of the pure Mt and pure illite interlayers are regarded as a refer-
ence for comparison with the other simulated cases.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, we
describe the simulation systems and procedures in Section 2. Then,
the results are presented in Section 3, and the summary of the
paper is drawn in the last section.

2. Methodology

2.1. Model construction

The 2:1 clay mineral models were constructed based on the
pyrophyllite structure with a chemical formula of Al4Si8O20(OH)4.
The lattice parameters of the pyrophyllite unit cell are: a = 5.16 Å,
b = 8.97 Å, and c = 9.37 Å, and a = 91.5°, b = 100.46°, and c = 89.6°
[50]. As is mentioned, Na+-Mt and K+-I were used with different
charge site locations and charge densities on the octahedral and
tetrahedral sheets to assess the swelling behavior of MLCs. The
chemical structure of the clays is characterized by the random iso-
morphic substitution of Al3+ by Mg2+ atoms and Si4+ by Al3+ atoms
in the octahedral and the tetrahedral sheet, respectively. The iso-
morphic substitutions also obey Loewenstein’s rule to avoid two
adjacent substitutions. In the present study, four different types
of mixed layers I-Mt clays were simulated that their chemical com-
positions and a charge per unit cell (uc) of them are shown in
Table1, and the initial structures of the clay mineral layer are
demonstrated in Fig. 1.

The supercell model of constructed I-Mt MLCs includes 4 clay
sheets (two sheets each of illite and Mt), where each layer contains
5  4 unit cells. As an example, for the case of I (HC)-Mt (HC) with
20 unit cells, the model has 20 isomorphous substitutions of Al3+
by Mg2+ in the octahedral sheets of Mt. In the illite clay sheets, 4
Al3+ were replaced with Mg2+ in the octahedral sheet as well as
replacement of 32 Si4+ with Al3+ in the tetrahedral sheet (16 in each
tetrahedral sheet). To balance the generated negative charge of lay-
ers, according to the charge quantity, counterions were added into
the interlayers. Therefore, 10 Na+ and 18 K+ were added between
the interlayer of Mt-Mt and I-I interlayers, while the remaining
cations were distributed between I-Mt clay interlayers.

2.2. Molecular dynamics simulation

All MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 5.1.2 Soft-
ware [51]. To generate the molecular structure of MLCs, CLAYFF

foreﬁeld [52] was used in combination with the ﬂexible point
charge (SPC) model for modeling the interlayer water molecules
[53]. In each simulation, the systems were minimized using the
steepest descent method. After energy minimization, 2 ns MD sim-
ulations in an isothermal   isobaric ensemble (NPT) were con-
ducted with the time step of 0.01 fs at the condition of T = 348 K
and P = 130 bar [54]. Then, the equilibrated system was put into
the additional 10 ns second of NPT with the time step of 1 fs at
the same pressure and temperature conditions to calculate the
basal spacing d-value of interlayers. At the ﬁnal stage, 5 ns NVT
simulations were conducted to achieve the equilibrated conﬁgura-
tions. The density proﬁle and the radial distribution function were
calculated from the equilibrated conﬁgurations. In all simulations,
the temperature and the pressure were controlled using
a V-rescale thermostat [55] and isotropic Parrinello-Rahman algo-
rithms [56], respectively. Periodic boundary conditions were
imposed in three directions, and applying the semi-isotropic pres-
sure allowed the system to freely expand the clay layers along the
Z-axis (See Fig. 2). To calculate long-range electrostatic interaction,
the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) summation method was applied
with an accuracy of 10 4. At the same time, the cut-off radius
was adjusted 1.4 nm for both Van Der Waals (VDW) and electro-
static interactions.

In this study, 4 different I-Mt systems were simulated for 1 to
10 water molecules per unit cell, indicating monolayer the (1 W)
and bilayer (2 W) hydration status of the MLCs. In general, 44 cases

were simulated, and in all simulations, water molecules were
randomly distributed in the interlayers after the distribution of
counterions in the middle of interlayers.

3. Results

3.1. Swelling and basal spacing

The MLCs crystalline swelling process was characterized by the
basal spacing d-value, deﬁning as the distance between tops of two
consecutive clay sheets for four different simulated systems as the
function of water molecules entering the interlayer. In the crys-
talline swelling regime of clays, the interlayer’s basal spacing d-
value presents stepwise increases, which indicate the transition
between two different hydrate states. First, in each hydration state,
some of the adsorbed water molecules hydrate counterions and
form the hydration shells. This step is the primary reason for the
interlayer expansion. Following this step, water content ﬁlls the
available remained space between interlayers in which minor
interlayer expansion will result [46].

In this study, the pure Mt and illite interlayers’ negative charge
was only compensated by adding Na+ and K+, respectively. More-
over, due to the difference in the required number of
cations - Na+ ions and K+ ions that we inserted between two I-Mt
interlayers in I (HC)-Mt (LC) and I (LC)-Mt (LC) simulation systems,
an interlayer with 7 Na+ and 18 K+ for I (HC)-Mt (LC) and 7 Na+ and
10 K+ for I (LC)-Mt (LC) were selected for analysis.

The d-values of pure Mt interlayer distance were consistent
with previously published experimental values and simulated
results [22,32,36]. The basal spacing d-value of pure illite interlay-
ers was in good agreement with recently published research by Li
et al.[37]. It should be noted that due to applying a range of charge
densities and charge site locations in previous studies, slight differ-
ences in both simulated and experimental results are acceptable.
Moreover, some of the small differences between the computed
and experimental results may be incorporated into the overesti-
mated surface-ion interaction for the surface oxygens in the
CLAYFF force ﬁeld.

Fig. 3a-d shows the group based on the absolute basal spacing
of interlayers for four distinct systems. Moreover, for a better
understanding of the swelling behavior of interlayers, the percent-
age of the relative increase in basal spacing of interlayers which are
computed bases on their dry state, are presented in Fig. 3e-h.

In general observation, they demonstrated that (i) the general
trends of the computed absolute basal spacing of interlayers in
each system were relatively similar, (ii) the absolute basal spacing
d-values of interlayers expanded similarly for both I (LC)-Mt (HC)
and the I (LC)-Mt (LC) during 1 W and 2 W hydrate statues, how-
ever, the slight difference between the absolute d-values were
observed for I (HC)-Mt (HC) and I (HC)-Mt (LC) in the presence of
high water concentrations, (iii) considering the percentage of the
relative increase in d-values of
interlayers, Mt-Mt interlayer
swelled the most compared to the other systems, (iv) in almost
all cases, swelling of the I-Mt clay were analogous to the I-I. This
revealed the dominant rule of K+ in the swelling behavior of I-
Mt. However, for the case of I (LC)-Mt (HC) and in comparison with
I (HC)-Mt (HC), an increasing number of Na+ in the presence of
lower concentrations of K+ gave rise to a higher basal spacing d-
value of I-Mt interlayer. In what follows, we provide more in-
depth insight into the observed swelling characteristic behavior
of interlayers by considering the relative basal spacing d values.

Comparing the swelling curve of

interlayers in Fig. 3e-h
revealed that the order of swelling in the symmetric Mt-Mt inter-
layer was higher than other interlayers in all simulated MLCs. To
understand the reasons behind the swelling behavior of systems,

three factors of hydration enthalpy of the interlayer counterions,
charge site locations, and charge quantity were considered for dif-
ferences in the interlayer distance. As we know, the lower the
hydration enthalpy of cations, the less interlayer swelling will
result. Since Na+ compared to K+ has a higher hydration
enthalpy-that is  406 and  320 kJ mol 1, respectively, the pres-
ence of Na+ leads to an increase in the interlayer distance as a
result of the formation of a larger hydration shell. The difference
in the basal spacing d-values of both the symmetric Mt-Mt and I-
I was not restricted to only hydration enthalpy of counterions.
Indeed, their structural differences in respect of the charge site
location and charge amount also had a great inﬂuence on the inter-
action of the cations and clay surfaces. In more detail, the main
negative charge of Mt clay sheets was due to octahedral substitu-
tions of Al3+ with Mg2+, however, illite sheets were more negatively
charged on the tetrahedral ones. Differences between charge loca-
tions culminated in a more strong interaction of counterions with
the illite surface. This is why the symmetric I-I interlayer had less
tendency to swell compared to the Mt-Mt interlayer. Furthermore,
in all cases, the I-Mt interlayers behaved fairly as similar to the I-I
interlayers except in the I (LC)-Mt (HC). In this case, the basal spac-
ing d-values were approximately the average interlayer distance
values of I-I and Mt-Mt for each separated water content. The
lower tetrahedral charge density of the illite sheet compared to
the high octahedral charge density of the Mt clay sheet as well
as the relative increase in Na+ in comparison with K+, may result
in such swelling behavior.

In order to investigate the effect of the charge amounts and
charge locations on the swelling behavior of interlayers, the rela-
tive basal spacing curves were grouped by the interlayer types in
Fig. 4. First, we assessed the effect of charge amounts on the Mt-
Mt and I-I interlayers’ swelling behavior, which are octahedrally
and tetrahedrally charged, respectively. Then, we look deep insight
into the inﬂuence of both mentioned factors on the changes of I-Mt
clay interlayer distance.

Fig. 4 indicates that the general trends in the basal spacing d-
value of both Mt-Mt interlayers were similar. Also, hydration states
of 1 W and 2 W and transition to them were manifest. At both high
and low water contents, the highly charged Mt clay sheet swelled
more compared to the slightly charged one. This is mainly due to
the weak counterion-clay surface interactions and high hydration
enthalpy of Na+, which resulted in forming of fully hydrated ions.
In fact, in the presence of more Na+ between the Mt-Mt interlayer,
more clay swelling was anticipated [29,37,46]. Also, Fig. 4 indicates
that the overall transition was the same for both I-I interlayers.
Regardless of the lower extension of the I-I interlayer compared
to the Mt-Mt interlayer, the presence of K+, as a low hydration
enthalpy counterion between the I-I interlayer region led to mono-
tonically swelling of the clay. As is shown, the more K+ in the inter-
layer, the more smoothly changes happened while clay swelling. In
addition, for highly charged illite clay sheets, the delay in transition
was observed due to the high number of K+ compared to the case
with lower charge density and their interaction with tetrahedral
sheets of illite. Considering the basal spacing d-value, during the
ﬁrst stage of hydration (1 W), the rate of changes in the basal spac-
ing of highly charged illite was a bit larger than the other cases.
However, at the compacted double layer water stage, the trend
was reversed in which the illite with higher charge density showed
less tendency to swell. In fact, high charge density on the tetrahe-
dral sheet of the illite and the more number of K+ were the major
reasons for the less-swelling behavior of illite compared with Mt.
As was mentioned, during the 1 W hydration state, illite with
low charged density had less tendency to expand compared to
the highly charged one. This means that presence of a lower num-
ber of K+ leaded to such behavior. During the 2 W hydration state,
however, the powerful interaction between K+ with the highly

charged tetrahedral sheets was the major reason for the lower
expansion of the interlayer in comparison with the low-charged
one. It should be mentioned that the obtained information of I-I
interlayer swelling tendency is consistent with the recently pub-
lished paper by Li et al. [37].

Fig. 5a-f compares the relative basal spacing variation of I-Mt
clay interlayer as a function of charge amounts and charge site
locations. To better gain a detailed understanding of the differ-
ences between the basal spacing of I-Mt clay interlayers, we

grouped the basal spacing curve of every two interlayers in a
graph. In this regard, the following points are worth mentioning:
(i) For the I-Mt clay interlayer in which illite had high charge den-
sity on the tetrahedral sheet, the swelling behavior of the I-Mt clay
interlayer was reasonably independent of charge amounts of the
Mt, which is octahedrally charged. (Fig. 5a), (ii) When the I-Mt clay
interlayer had low tetrahedral charge density on the illite sheets,
charge amounts of the Mt played a signiﬁcant role in the swelling
behavior of the interlayer. In more detail, the lower charge of illite

sheets and the more charge of Mt sheets in the I-Mt clay interlayer
resulted in higher swelling and distance of interlayer (Fig. 5b-c,f),
(iii) The swelling behavior of a system including a high charge illite
sheet, regardless of the charge amounts of Mt, was similar to the I-
Mt clay interlayer. The reasons behind such behavior of I-Mt clay
interlayers are related to the following key important facts. First,
the identity of the interlayer’s counterions. In mixed-ion MLCs, a

high fraction of K+ reduces the swelling tendency of interlayers.
This is due to no powerful attraction between K+ and water mole-
cules. However, in the same fraction of K+ and Na+, the possibility
of swelling behavior of clay increases [57]. Second, charge locations
and charge amounts. When MLCs are more negatively charged on
the tetrahedral sheet of illite, the interaction between counterions
and surface sheet will increase, in which the possibility of their
hydration is reduced, especially for Na+. On the other hand, in
the case of the low charge density of I-Mt clay, no serious hydra-
tion was observed due to fewer Na+.

3.2. Atomic density proﬁle

The distribution of interlayer cations and water molecules in
the clay interlayers were quantiﬁed by the one-dimension atomic
density proﬁle for 1 W and 2 W hydrate states and are illustrated
in Figs. 6–8. Comparison of the atomic density proﬁles of simulated
systems give a better insight into the effect of charge locations and
charge density on the interactions of counterions with the clay
surface.

proﬁles with high charge and low charge density on the octahedral
sheet of the clays. For both cases, in the 1 W hydrate state, Na+

formed a broad peak with a shoulder near each clay surface. For the
highly charged Mt, however, the shoulder was sharper, which indi-
cated higher hydration and, as a result, more interlayer swelling. As
the water content increased and the 2 W hydrate state formed, the
broad centered proﬁle of Na+ was changed to a single peak at the
midplane signifying the outer-sphere surface complex (OSSC). It

should be noted that the shaper cation peaks in 2 W hydrate state
of the high charge Mt was may be due to the imposed forces of
water molecules on counterions to be transferred from clay surface
to the center of interlayers, not because of higher hydration [47].
For the low charge Mt case, besides a single peak at the midplane,
the clay surface represented the
two small peaks near

inner-sphere surface complex (ISSC). This may be due to negative
charge distribution on the tetrahedral layer and weakness of CLAFF
force ﬁeld, which overestimates surface oxygen-ion interaction. In
the case of the high charge Mt in the 2 W hydrate state, two minor
peaks were observed approximately less than 1.0 Å from surface
oxygen atoms. This was due to unusual adsorption within ditrigo-
nal cavities on the basal surface, so-called ‘‘anhydrous” [29]. It
should be noted that the anhydrous ions were weakly detectable
for the 1 W state of the high charge Mt.

Comparing the distribution of interlayer water molecules of Mt
in Fig. 6.a-d revealed that in the case of 1 W hydrate state, the
amount of charge density had no considerable inﬂuence on the
water molecules distribution. On the other hand, in the 2 W
hydrate state, an increase in charge density of the octahedral sheet
resulting from the replacement of Al3+ with Mg2+ led to the pres-
ence of more hydrogen atoms of water near the oxygen on the
clay’s surface. Such interactions stemmed from the high polariza-
tion power of Mg2+ compared to the Al3+ ions. In the 2 W hydrate
state, the oxygen peaks around central cations for both the low
charge Mt and high charge Mt were relatively the same value indi-
cating the cation hydration’s similar tendency as previous analysis
basal spacing d-value showed. The density proﬁle of the Mt system
was also consistent with the earlier studies [29,30,46,47].

The atomic density proﬁle of the illite interlayer water mole-
cules and K+ are shown in Fig. 7a-d. At low charge density, the pref-
erence of the interlayer K+ was forming the ISSC instead of the
OSSC. For both 1 W and 2 W hydrate states, there was no sharp
peak of cations in the midplane due to the low hydration enthalpy
of K+ (Fig. 7.a,c). That was why the low tetrahedrally charged illite
had less tendency to swell. Moreover, another insight that proved
the less-swelling behavior of this system was that hydration states
did not inﬂuence the distribution of water molecules. In more
detail, the water oxygen’s prominent peak and the ﬁrst peak of
water hydration were virtually remained unchanged in different
hydration states.

At high charge density, the two sharp peaks of K+ near the clay
surface exhibited strong interaction of the ions with the surface,
which resulted in forming the ISSC. Such interaction was due to
the high charge density of tetrahedral sheet and was the major rea-
son for the less-swelling behavior of illite compared to Mt. Further-
more, in contrast to the Na+-Mt system that adding water to the
interlayer forced the Na+ to move from hexagonal sites to the sites
above the tetrahedral sheet, in high charge illite system, the dis-
tance of K+ remained nearly unperturbed by increasing the water
content. As similar to the low charge density, the interlayer water
molecules’ distribution was not changed when the hydration state
was transformed to 1 W from 2 W. The water oxygen’s prominent
peaks and the ﬁrst peak of water hydration approximately
remained constant at 2.5 Å and 1.5 Å for 1 W and 2 W hydration
states, respectively (Fig. 7b,d). The obtained results also agree well
with the previous study [37].

Fig. 8a-f show the I-Mt clay interlayers’ atomic distribution for
the simulated systems with different charge locations and charge
sites at the 1 W and 2 W hydrate states. As discussed in the previ-
ous section, two reasons for the lower hydration enthalpy of K+ and
high charge density on tetrahedral sheets of illite were considered
as effective items on low basal spacing d-value of I-Mt clay inter-
layers. Considering the I (HC)-Mt (HC) and I (HC)-Mt (LC) interlay-
ers, the atomic density proﬁles were relatively close to each other.
Fig. 8a,b indicate that at 1 W hydrate state, the preference of coun-
terions was forming strong bonds with clay surface instead of
hydration with water molecules. In fact, the high charge density
of the illite tetrahedral sheet was the major reason for the adsorp-
tion of the counterions onto the clay surface and ISSC formation.
The effect of the charge density was such that the strong interac-
tion of Na+ with illite surface led to ions penetration in the ditrig-

9

onal cavities of the siloxane surface. This also suggested that the
ditrigonal cavities were better ﬁts for Na+ than K+ [37]. On the
Mt side of the I (HC)-Mt (HC) interlayer, ISSC was only formed
for and K+, while their numbers were not comparable with the illite
surface side. For the I (HC)-Mt (LC) interlayer, besides the ISSC of
K+, the small peak of Na+ near the Mt side of the interlayer repre-
sented the ISSC. The difference in forming ISSC of Na+ with Mt sur-
face originated from various polarization power of Mg2+ in the
octahedral sheet between the high charge Mt and low charge
one. In more detail, comparing water molecules distribution of
two discussed interlayers, Fig. 8a,b. indicate that water molecules
preferred to establish strong hydrogen bonds with the Mt surface
rather than the illite surface, which may be due to perturbable
properties of K+ and even high charge density of the Mt on the
octahedral sheet. The fact is that the more octahedral substitution
of Al3+ with Mg 2+ in Mt clay, the shaper peak of the water hydro-
gen near the Mt surface will result. High polarization power Mg2+
compared to the Al3+ is responsible for the difference. Therefore,
the more tendency of water molecules to be adsorbed on high
charged Mt imposed force on Na+ to transfer from near the Mt sur-
face to the middle of the interlayer. On the other hand, the denser
layer substitution of the illite adsorbed detached ions on its sur-
face. That was why no Na+ were present near the Mt surface to
form the ISSC and almost all of the ions were concentrated near
illite surface. As was shown in the previous section, in the 1 W
hydration state, the swelling behavior of the I (HC)-Mt (HC) and I
(HC)-Mt (LC) was analogous to illite as the less-swelling clay
minerals.

In the 2 W hydrate state, interlayer molecules’ distribution was
generally similar for both simulated systems (Fig. 8e,f). A majority
of K+ were placed close to the illite surface and were attributed to
the ISSC. The weaker peak of K+ next to the Mt surface was also
consistent with the ISSC. Because of the lower hydration enthalpy
of K+ and less tendency to hydrate, as well as strong interaction
with the clay mineral surface, there was no peak in the midplane.
As the water content increased, although most of the Na+ remained
close to the illite surface, some Na+ appeared at the midplane of the
interlayer ascribing to the OSSC and cation hydration. As discussed
in Section 3.1, the same swelling behavior was seen in the case of I
(HC)-Mt (HC) and I (HC)-Mt (LC) for 2 W hydrate state in which
increases in water content caused the slight increase in interlayer
distance compared to the illite. The OSSC of Na+ in I-Mt clay clari-
ﬁed the difference in the basal spacing d-values of studied systems.
Moreover, as similar to the 1 W hydration state, ISSC of Na+ with
Mt surface was only formed when the charge of Mt was low, and
water molecules tended to be adsorbed by the Mt surface rather
than illite, especially for the highly charged Mt.

Fig. 8c,d,g,h demonstrate the atomic distribution in I-Mt where
the Mt has variable charge densities while illite has low charge
density on the tetrahedral sheet. The results manifested signiﬁcant
differences with the two described cases, which included the
highly charged illite. As is clear, the distribution of atoms depends
on the layer charge density of clays. In the case of the high charge
illite, most of the atoms preferred to have strong interaction with a
clay surface. On the other hand, it seems that when the system
included the low-charge illite, hydration enthalpy of counterions
played major role in the swelling behavior of the system. Fig. 8c
shows that the interlayer Na+ were mainly presented in the middle
of the interlayer with a relative tendency towards the illite surface
at the 1 W hydrate state. While the majority of Na+ were dis-
tributed near the illite surface rather than the midplane for the I
(LC)-Mt (LC) interlayer at 1 W hydrate state. That contributed to
more swelling of the I (LC)-Mt (HC) interlayer. Comparing the
interlayer K+ distribution, most of the K+ formed ISSC near both
sides of the clay surface instead of creating the OSSC (Fig. 8c,d).
This is mainly related to their low hydration enthalpy. In addition,

similar to the previous cases we studied, the preference of the
water molecule had hydrogen bonds with Mt surface, as the shaper
peak of hydrogen was shown (Fig. 8c,d.).

In the 2 W hydrate state of I (LC)-Mt (LC) and I (LC)-Mt
(HC), the distribution of ions was relatively analogous to each
other (Fig. 8g,h). For both K+ and Na+ in the I (LC)-Mt (LC)
interlayer, the presence of two peaks near clay surfaces and a
single peak at the midplane indicated ISSC and OSSC, respec-
interlayer, although K+ were
tively.

In the I

(LC)-Mt

(HC)

distributed as similar as the former case, Na+ formed a rela-
tively sharp peak at the midplane and ISSC near the illite sur-
face with no interaction to the Mt surface. As was mentioned,
the higher tendency of water molecules to the high charge Mt
surface pushed the Na+ to the middle of the interlayer. In addi-
tion, due to the low charge density of illite on the tetrahedral
sheet, no strong interactions were observed so as to adsorb
these detached ions. As a result, more Na+ were hydrated by
water molecules that culminated in more swelling.

3.3. Radial distribution functions

Interaction between interlayer ions and water/surface of clay
sheet was explored by calculating RDF g(r) of Na+-Ow/Os and K+-
Ow/Os in the Mt-Mt, I-I, and I-Mt with various charge density and
charge location. In this analysis, the surface oxygen atom of a clay
sheet and a water oxygen atom are symbolized by Os and Ow,
respectively. In all simulated cases, regardless of variations in
charge density, the main peak location of Na+-Ow and K+-Ow
attributing to the ﬁrst hydration shell appear at about 2.4 Å and
2.78 Å, respectively, which agree with previous studies [57-59].

Journal of Molecular Liquids 335 (2021) 116188

Fig. 9 demonstrates the RDFs for the Mt-Mt systems. The
height of the peak of Na+-Os for Mt (HC)-Mt (HC) was higher
than the low charged Mt. This may be interpreted that the
highly charged Mt attracted more Na+ towards the clay surface,
however, this was mainly due to the presence of more Na+.
Also, an increase in water content
led to signiﬁcant
changes in the location of Na+ from the surface to midplane
of the interlayer for both types of Mt conﬁrmed it. As was men-
tioned, the higher number of counterions gives rise to more
swelling. That is why the Mt-Mt with more charge experience
more expansion.

Fig. 12. RDF for K+-OW and Na+-Os at monolayer hydrate state (black) and bilayer hydrate state (red), I (HC)-Mt (HC) (a,b), I (HC)-Mt (LC) (c,d), I (LC)-Mt (HC) (e,f), and I (LC)-
Mt (LC) (g,h). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Fig. 10 also presents the RDF value of K+-Ow/Os in I-I systems.
Owing to the low hydration enthalpy of K+, the value of rk-Os/Ow
was considerably lower than rNa-Os/Ow. In addition, the RDFs of rk-
Os conﬁrmed the results of both basal spacing d-values and proﬁle
density of I-I. When water content increased, no K+ migrated to the
middle of the illite clay interlayer. Indeed, low hydration enthalpy
of K+ as well as tetrahedrally charged of illite were the reasons of
the less-swelling behavior of illite compared to Mt.

Fig. 11 presents the RDFs of the Na+-Ow/Os in I-Mt clays with
different charge densities and charge site locations. In all cases,
the gradual increase in water content between interlayers gave rise
to a decrease in the intensity of the main peaks of Na+-Ow. As is
shown, the highest central peak Na+-Ow was for the I (LC)-Mt
(HC) case, which was in agreement with previous results indicating

the great swelling behavior of the MLCs. Considering the RDFs val-
ues of Na+-Os, as water content increased in which monolayer
hydrate state was changed to bilayer one, in general, a decrease
in the height of peak indicated moving interlayer counterions
towards the midplane of the interlayer. It should be noted that ions
immigration behavior was not the same and was dependent on the
charge density of clay sheet, which affected counterions-clay sur-
face interaction. The results revealed that the presence of the high
charge illite in the MLCs, most of the Na+ with ISSC prefer to remain
near the clay surface. This is due to the strong adsorption of the Na+
on the clay sheet and an ‘‘anhydrous” behavior. In addition, the
interesting obtained result was that in the I (HC)-Mt (HC), the ﬁrst
main peak of Na+-Os for the bilayer hydrate state was higher com-
pared to the monolayer one. This signiﬁcant increase was mostly

12

M. Ghasemi and M. Shariﬁ

due to the adsorption of Na+ to illite clay sheets, which were
detached through the pushing force of water molecules that had
a strong tendency towards clay surface and hydrogen bonds forma-
tion (Fig. 11b). Moreover, considerable changes in the location of
interlayer ions in the I (LC)-Mt (HC) when water molecules
increased conﬁrmed the high swelling behavior of this system.
For the I (LC)-Mt (LC) case, a decrease in the height of peak location
was also evident at the 2 W hydrate state in comparison with the
monolayer one. However, the major reason for interlayer reluc-
tance to expand was the fewer number of Na+ in the presence of K+.
Fig. 12 also indicates the RDFs of the K+-Ow/Os in I-Mt. The RDF
value of K+-Ow decreased as the water content increased. Needless
to say that the main peak of K+-Ow for all four simulated cases was
lower than Na+-Ow peaks because K+ was reluctant to fully hydrate.
Furthermore, comparing the height of K+-Ow showed that when
MLCs include high charge illite, the order of rcation-Ow was lower
than the case with low charge illite. This is mainly due to strong
cation-illite surface interaction. The RDFs of the K+-Os revealed
no signiﬁcant changes in the location of K+, as the hydration state
was changed to bilayer from monolayer. The reluctance of K+ to
move towards the midplane was not only due to lower hydration
enthalpy of the countetions but due to the presence of high charge
clay sheet in the MLC, as well. In the presence of no high-charge
clay sheet, some of the counterions immigrated to the midplane
as water content increased (Fig. 11h). However, the reluctance of
K+ to hydrate resulted in lower interlayer expansion.

4. Summary

The present work investigated the crystalline swelling behavior
of K+-I-Na+-Mt with different layer charges by using molecular
dynamics simulation. Through a comparison of four different I-
Mt clay systems with various charge amounts and charge distribu-
tion and simultaneous analysis of the basal spacing d-values, den-
sity proﬁle, and RDFs to have a precise interpretation of systems,
we observed subtle points in the crystalline swelling behavior of
I-Mt structures. In the presence of highly tetrahedral charged illite
in the I-Mt clay, regardless of the octahedral sheet charge quantity
of Mt, the crystalline swelling behavior of the MLCs followed the
swelling behavior of illite. However, the charge distribution of
the Mt played pivotal roles in the swelling of the MLCs when the
system included low-charged illite or the Mt and illite have the
same charge density. In addition to the charge distribution of the
MLCs, the counterion hydration effect can also be considered a crit-
ical factor in the interlayer expansion of MLCs. Indeed, I-Mt clays
with low charged illite were highly affected by the hydration
effect. In the case of a low tetrahedral charge of illite, an increase
in Na+ in respect of K+ changed the swelling behavior of I-Mt clay
towards following Mt swelling behavior. However, the strong
interaction of Na+ with highly tetrahedral charged of illite in I-Mt
clay minimized the hydration effect. Furthermore, the I-Mt system,
including Mt with highly octahedral charged sheet and illite with
low charge density increased polarization of water molecules lead-
ing to adsorption of water molecules near the Mt clay surface. This
affected the polarization of the other atoms, and as a result of
water molecule adsorption, Na+ immigrated into the midplane of
the structure and started hydration. This increased the interlayer
distance of the I-Mt clay system. Such behavior revealed how the
Mt octahedral substitutions have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on clay
swelling. Overall, besides charge quantity, both tetrahedral and
octahedral substitution greatly inﬂuence the interlayer expansion
of clay systems.
